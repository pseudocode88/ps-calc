# Trader Bruh

Recently I started trading and to calculate position size I used spreadsheet to manage. But for my ease, thought of build as desktop app so that I can pin the window on top while calulcating the position size. Actually I want to build a trading journal with the tools required, but being the scope is huge, I'm diving the scope into smaller achieveable chunks.

## Commands
```
# Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# To start the dev environment
$ yarn run start

# To build the app
$ yarn run build
```

### Version v1.0
- Simple position size calculator shows the risk and margin
- Simple trading account setup with the capital and min-max risk
